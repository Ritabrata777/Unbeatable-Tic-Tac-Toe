## 📌 Features

- 🎮 Play as `X` vs a smart AI (`O`)
- 🤖 AI uses Minimax algorithm with depth-based scoring (impossible to beat)
- 🧠 Computer always plays optimal moves
- 🔁 Automatic game reset after win/draw
- ✅ Clean and intuitive user interface using `tkinter`
---

### Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `tkinter` (pre-installed with Python on most systems)

🧠AI Logic

The AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm, which simulates all possible future moves and selects the one with the optimal outcome. It:

Maximizes its own chance of winning

Minimizes the player's chances

Accounts for depth to prioritize quicker victories and delay defeats
